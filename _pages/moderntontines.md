## The global retirement challenge
> Retirement Decumulation is the "nastiest, hardest, problem in finance" - William Sharpe

 Indeed, this may well be true… at least for those who try to manage longevity risk on their own.  But by pooling their risk with others, people can greatly diversify and reduce this risk.  In fact, risk pooling is so effective that it can facilitate the virtual assurance of lifetime income for everyone.  Not only that, but it also allows individuals to achieve significantly higher levels of retirement income.

It’s really quite simple.  Through risk sharing, a tontine changes the conditional distribution of retirement outcomes in a very useful way – those who live long lives are subsidized by those who die earlier.  For those who are relying on a portfolio to generate income over a highly uncertain and potentially long remaining lifetime, this is exactly what they should want.

So, the lesson we all learned as children in kindergarten is true – life is better when we share!

## Modern Tontines
We are not talking about the tontines of past centuries.  We are talking about modern tontines that are open-ended and therefore do not suffer from shrinking membership over time.

* A) perpetual
* B) flexible
* C) transparent
* and D) actuarially fair to all investors at all times

## What about Collective Defined Contribution (CDC) schemes?
We believe that the fair tontine principle should be the foundation of any longevity risk-sharing arrangement, including CDC schemes.  We can help CDC sponsors and their providers design and administer their plans fairly and efficiently, in perpetuity.

## Is it an annuity?
Tontines do provide annuity-like income, but they are not annuities in the insurance sense of the word because they provide no insurance whatsoever.  Rather, a tontine simply pays out an individual’s retirement savings back to them over time in the most efficient way possible, dispensing with the added costs of insurance and guarantees.  So although the exact amount of income is not guaranteed, investors can expect to receive higher payouts on average from a tontine than from a comparable annuity.

Those who desire an insured lifetime income with a guaranteed payout level can buy an annuity.  Those who instead desire an assured lifetime payout that is likely (though not guaranteed) to be higher can buy a tontine.  Fair tontines also have a number of other benefits relative to annuities:
*	They are very transparent in terms of operation and pricing
*	They do not expose the buyer to insurance counterparty risk as is the case of payout annuities
*	They can offer the flexibility to choose from among a number of investment strategies and payout types
*	Investors benefit fully from upside risk
