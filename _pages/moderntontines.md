   excerpt: "> Modern Tontines solve the retirement challenge by pooling longevity risk.


              By design, Modern Tontines allow flexible contributions, personalized benefit options — lifetime or term-specific, immediate or deferred — optional joint-ownership, and the possibility of a bequest.
              <br><br>
              It is suitable for both pre-retirement saving (accumulation) and post-retirement income (decumulation).

   title: "Superior Returns"
   excerpt: ">With individualized fully funded schemes, asset allocation can be personalized to fit each investor's needs, investment preferences, and financial fluency.


          By combining traditional asset returns with longevity credits that are uncorrelated to those returns, Modern Tontines are competitive tools in the retirement ecosystem.
          <br><br>
          With streamlined administration fees and no guarantee charges, their net return is unbeatable.

   excerpt: ">Modern tontines offer low capital requirements and a low administrative burden, allowing financial institutions to offer lifetime income at low cost.


   Nuovalo's actuarial techniques ensure the fair distribution of lifetime income. Our designs are transparent, sustainable and always fully funded.
   <br><br>
   Since the collective pooling of longevity is self-insured, there are no guarantee fees for the members and no guarantee-related liability for the provider.
