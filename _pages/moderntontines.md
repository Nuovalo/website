   title: "Efficient P2P Pool"
   excerpt: ">Nuovalo's Actuarial techniques and methods ensure fairness and facilitate the distribution of assured lifetime income to each participant. Our designs are transparent, sustainable and always fully funded.


              The pooling of longevity is self-insured - resulting in no guarantee fees for the members and no liability for the carrier. The efficiency of the schemes provide much lower administrative burden.
              <br>
              This in turns translates in low risk, low capital requirement and low fees.

             If your savings survive you, that's equally inefficient.”


             Indeed ! And **low interest rates** with **increased longevity** won't help.
