   excerpt: "> The principle of Modern Tontine Finance solves the retirement challenge by pooling longevity risk.


              By design, modern longevity risk pooling allows flexible contributions, personalized benefit options (for example, lifetime or term-specific, immediate or deferred), optional joint-ownership, and the possibility of a bequest.
              <br><br>
              It is suitable for both pre-retirement saving (accumulation) and post-retirement income (decumulation).

   title: "Superior Returns"
   excerpt: ">With individualized fully funded schemes, asset allocation can be personalized to fit each investor's needs, investment preferences, and financial fluency.


          By combining traditional asset returns with longevity credits that are uncorrelated to those returns, the principle of
          Modern Tontine Finance represents a powerful tool within the retirement ecosystem.
          <br><br>
          With streamlined administration fees and no guarantee charges, the net return is unbeatable.

   title: "Efficient P2P Pooling"
   excerpt: ">Modern Tontine Finance offers low capital requirements and a low administrative burden, allowing financial institutions to offer lifetime income at low cost.


   Nuovalo's actuarial techniques ensure the fair distribution of lifetime income. Our designs are transparent, sustainable and always fully funded.
   <br><br>
   Since the collective pooling of longevity is self-insured, there are no guarantee fees for the members and no guarantee-related liability for the provider.

   excerpt: ">“If you survive your pension savings, you will be poor!

             If your savings survive you, that's equally inefficient.” — Jose Herce         


             Indeed ! And **low interest rates** with **increased longevity** won't help.
