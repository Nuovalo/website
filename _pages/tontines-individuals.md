# Why should I care about retirement planning ?

## Pension are expensive to fund - and it just got worse...
Adequate Financial planning for retirement is one of the toughest problems to solve - and it just got worse: interests are record low and life annuities have become prohibitively expensive.    
Even plain vanilla savings products are too expensive: an average insurance policy linked to markets will in average cost **2~3% per year**, while standard equity funds charge up to 1.5% in annual fees. Compounded over the years and horizon of retirement, John and Mary savings will be greatly diminished – and it might not even cover the increased living expenses.

## Self saving ? Yes, but planning for how long ?
We therefore rely mostly on state pensions and on personal savings. State pensions are great but often not sufficient.
Personal savings are not designed to cover your retirements needs, since it doesn’t integrate the uncertainty linked to one’s life. For instance, a new retiree can expect to live for 25 years in average. But if healthy, they can very well outlive the average population by 5 years, 10 years, 25 years...     

## Pooling longevity
