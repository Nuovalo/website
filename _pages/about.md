We are a sister company to [**Nuova Longevità Research**](https://www.nuovalongevita.com/), founded by [**Richard Fullmer**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-fullmer-b4b00a2/), a leading pioneer of modern tontine research and design.

Indeed, research is in our DNA… and in case you didn’t notice, [**Nuovalo**](/) is short for [**Nuova Longevità**](https://www.nuovalongevita.com/). We like the name, which means New Longevity in Italian, because it embraces our spirit of bringing new and innovative solutions to the lifetime income challenge.
