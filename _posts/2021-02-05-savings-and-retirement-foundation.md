We presented our research, conducted jointly with professor Jonathan Forman of the University of Oklahoma College of Law, to the Savings and Retirement Foundation on 3 February 2021. The subject was our work — conducted through sister company [Nuova Longevità Research](https://www.nuovalongevita.com) — on an innovative solution for assuring lifetime income in state-sponsored retirement savings plans.

The basis for the presentation can be found in [this paper](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1688&context=prc_papers) that discusses the concept and the research. The general idea is that a simple tontine-based solution that delivers assured lifetime income could be added as an option to virtually any defined contribution (DC) plan. This solution could help provide retirement income security for millions of private-sector workers who currently lack pension coverage, with minimal risk to the government as sponsor.
