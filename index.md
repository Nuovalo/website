    excerpt:
          "Modern Tontines provide better returns and can be designed flexibly with customizable payout options and individualized asset allocation. They are always fully funded (and thus truly sustainable) and have low capital requirements since they assure lifetime income without the use of third-party insurance, making them a limited-risk undertaking to the provider.
